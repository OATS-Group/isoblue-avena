# Ansible role: avena-wireguard

## Description

This role will establish a Wireguard VPN connection between an Avena node and
Wireguard bounce server.

TODO: Route all traffic over the Wireguard interface

Benefits:

1. Simple, yet secure connection -- Its hard to know what is between ISOBlue and
   your backend.
2. Cryptography routed -- roaming between primary IPs / interfaces is seamless.
3. NAT breaker -- Using Wireguard keepalives, Avena node are always accessible
   by any other node within the same Wireguard VPN, even when behind a private
   NAT.

## Assumptions

1. Debian Buster (or newer) OR an `apt` based distribution with a modern
   `wireguard` package available.
2. The nodes `ansible_host` value is set to the desired Wireguard VPN IP.
